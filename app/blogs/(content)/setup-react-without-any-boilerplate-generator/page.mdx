In this blog, I'm sharing my experience when trying to setup react project from scratch, what errors I got and how I resolved them.
After reading this blog, you will understand why we don't setup our project from scratch.

### The Simple Start

Till now you were building websites using simple HTML,CSS and JavaScript, so again you begin with pure JavaScript:

index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

index.js

```javascript
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.textContent = "Hello world";
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(div);
```

You open `index.html` directly in the browser using `file://` protocol something like `file://path/to/the/index.html`, and voil√†! A **nice** "Hello world" appears.

---

Someone suggests why don't you use React for building your websites. You naively add:

```javascript
const react = require("react");
```

**Error:** `require` is not defined.

Why? because `require()` and `module.exports()` comes from CommanJS module system that was primarily designed for Node.js environment.
So Browser's javascript engine don't natively understand it but if you still want to use it you need to use a bundler eg: Webpack
or parcel that can bundle `require()` into browser compactible code. Without a bundler like Webpack, this is like speaking French
to someone who only knows Mandarin.

Now you decided to move on ES Modules that browser supports natively:

```javascript
import react from "react";
```

Congrats, you get a new error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: import declarations may only appear at top level of a module.
```

This error occur because using import/export that are part of ES modules and using them in a plain JS script, make script a module too, so
scripts using import/export must be explicitly marked as modules in HTML

```html
<script src="index.js" type="module"></script>
```

##### Let's just clear the mist between Classic Script and Modules.

**Classic script**

- Variable and function are added to the global scope(window object), All top level declaration are global.
- Code runs immediately as it is loaded.
- Executes in the order it appears in the HTML document.
- `<script src='index.js'></script>`

**Modules**

- Each module has its own scope, meaning variables and functions declared at the top level are not added to the global scope.
- Can be loaded asynchronously,
- Execution order is managed by the module dependencies.
- `<script src='index.js' type="module"></script>`

**What is a Module?**
A piece of code, that designed to be reusable, allowing it to be imported in other part of application.

In JavaScript, there are two main types of modules:

1. **ES Modules (ESM)** - Modules are loaded asynchronously.
2. **CommonJS Modules (CJS)** - Modules are loaded synchronously, that is not efficient for browsers, but works well in Node JS.

---

Now, After opening `index.html` via `file://` throws a stupid **CORS error**.

**Why?**
This is because of how browsers handle loading file via `file://` protocol. In our case we are trying to open `index.html` file
directly in browser using `file://`, and in our file we have a script that we marked as `module` and that's the twist, browser
treats these module as a cross origin request that requires special security checks, even though they are on your local machine,
And each file that you load treated as having its own origin,and when `index.js` is trying to load, it is going from one origin
to another origin that will cause `CORS error`.

**Fix: Use a local server**
Install `http-server`:

```bash
pnpm add http-server
pnpm exec http-server .
```

So the CORS error is gone now,

---

As you were importing react directly, you get:

```javascript
import react from "react";
```

New error:

```
The specifier ‚Äúreact‚Äù was a bare specifier. but was not remapped to anything. Relative module specifiers must start with ‚Äú./‚Äù, ‚Äú../‚Äù or ‚Äú/‚Äù.
```

**Why?**
Browser is confused here, that bro where I can find `react`, In normal case this line work because
behind the scene we had a bundler that simplify the things for us but here until now we have nothing like bundler.
Browsers can‚Äôt resolve npm paths without help.

So you need to put the actual path here, Use the UMD(Universal Module Defination) build from node_modules.

```javascript
import "./node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js";

const React = window.React; // Now React is global!
console.log("React version:", React.version);
```

For our actual `index.js` code, we can change that to something like:

```javascript
import "../node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js";
import "../node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js";

const React = window.React;
const ReactDOM = window.ReactDOM;

const div = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello world");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(div);
```

But this feels **dirty**. Now this is not the code we see in `create-react-app` boilerplate code.
To make our code to look like that we need to add few more dependencies.

---

- **Webpack**: It is a module bundler, that will take multiple JS files and their dependencies and packages them into one single optimized bundle for use in web browser.

```bash
pnpm add -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

- **Babel**: It is JS compiler, that can convert latest version of JS, Typescript, JSX into a simple JS that can run into browser and different environments

```zsh
pnpm add -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

and for to simplify the creation of HTML files to serve your Webpack bundles.

```bash
pnpm add -D html-webpack-plugin
```

We also need to configure babel and webpack here,

Configure Babel (`.babelrc`):

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/preset-env"],
    ["@babel/preset-react", { "runtime": "automatic" }]
  ]
}
```

Webpack Config (`webpack.config.js`):

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./index.jsx",
  mode: "development",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./dist"),
    filename: "index_bundle.js",
  },
  devServer: {
    port: "5000",
    static: { directory: path.join(__dirname, "public") },
  },
  resolve: { extensions: [".js", ".jsx"] },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: "babel-loader" },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: "./public/index.html" })],
};
```

### React Code, Finally! üéâ

`public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

`src/app.jsx`

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "Hello world in React");
};
export default App;
```

`index.jsx`

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./src/app";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

---

###### Here we go!!

```bash
npx webpack serve
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and there it is‚Äî**Hello world in React!** No more errors, no more tears. You‚Äôve survived the React setup and now you know why we use the create-react-app. üöÄ
